## [**Project 1: Layoff 2020-2023**](https://github.com/gellerigor/SQL_projects/tree/main/Data_cleaning_and_EDA_project_layoff_dataset) 
*   I employed a variety of techniques to clean the dataset effectively. I utilized the TRIM function to remove extra white spaces, window functions to identify and handle duplicates, update and alter table commands to modify column data types. These techniques, combined with meticulous attention to detail, ensured the dataset's integrity and prepared it for insightful analysis and informed decision-making.
*  After completing data cleaning, I conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using SQL techniques. This included calculating summary statistics, determining MIN and MAX dates for future time series analysis, extracting year and month data using EXTRACT and TO_CHAR functions, and leveraging window functions alongside Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for comprehensive calculations. These analyses provided valuable insights into the dataset's characteristics and temporal patterns, laying a solid foundation for subsequent analysis and decision-making.
* The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swaptr/layoffs-2022) was sourced from Kaggle.


## [**Project 2: Netflix Movies and TV Shows**](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/igor.geller/viz/Netflix_17066746999630/Dashboard1) 
* I designed a comprehensive dashboard utilizing Tableau, integrating diverse visualizations to succinctly present and interpret complex datasets.
* The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows/data) was sourced from Kaggle, a renowned platform for open data, providing a robust foundation for analysis and exploration in the designated project.

## [**Project 3: How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success**](https://github.com/gellerigor/R_projects/tree/main/bike_sharing_project)
* Ð¡ombined several CSV files into one, cleaning and organizing the data for future analysis.
* Conducted a comparative descriptive analysis between annual members and casual riders, aiming to discern distinct patterns in their utilization of Cyclistic bikes.
* Employed ggplot2 to visually represent and communicate key insights derived from the comparative analysis.
